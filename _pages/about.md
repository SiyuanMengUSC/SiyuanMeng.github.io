I am a second year master student major in Mechanical Engineering (Dynamics and Control) at University of Southern California

My research interests lie in the design, control, and dynamics of legged and wheeled robots, particularly in enhancing their mobility in complex and challenging environments. Specifically, I am interested in robotic locomotion over uneven and deformable terrains such as mud or sand, where the interaction between the robot and the terrain plays a crucial role. My goal is to develop advanced control strategies, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Quadratic Programming (QP), to improve the robotâ€™s adaptability and efficiency in these scenarios.

I am also a Powerlifter! Best: Second prize in USAPL TSS competition!

On my way to Robotics-Powerlifting Scientist!!!
